        <li>2 cloves Garlic</li>

        <li>3 Spring Onions</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the chicken in a bowl. Add the buttermilk, salt, pepper, and garlic salt. Mix together, cover and place in the fridge to marinade for at least 1 hour (up to overnight)
            4 chicken breasts,240 ml (1 cup) buttermilk,1/2 tsp salt,1/4 tsp white pepper,1/4 tsp garlic salt</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to a low heat (to keep the cooked chicken warm). Heat a large pan of vegetable oil (or preheat your deep fat fryer) until hot (you can test by dropping a small cube of bread in there, if it rises immediately to the top and starts to bubble rapidly, it’s hot enough). You’ll need at least 1 litre (4 cups) of oil.

        <li>Mix together the crispy coating ingredients in a small bowl.
            180 g (1 1/2 cups) plain (all-purpose) flour,1 tsp salt,1 tsp ground black pepper,1/2 tsp garlic salt,½ tsp celery salt,1 tsp dried thyme,1 tsp paprika,1 tsp baking powder,1 tsp chilli flakes</li>
        <li>Take the chicken out of the fridge. Lift a piece from the buttermilk and allow the excess to drip off. Dredge the chicken in the crispy coating mixture – ensuring it’s fully covered. Place on a tray and repeat until all of the chicken is coated.</li>
        <li>Once the oil is hot enough, add in 5 or 6 of the chicken tenders. You can add more or less depending on the size of your pan, just be sure not to overcrowd the chicken.</li>
        <li>Cook for 3-5 minutes until golden brown and cooked in the middle. You can check this by cutting open a piece of chicken, if it’s no longer pink in the middle, it’s cooked.</li>
        <li>Place on a tray in the oven to keep warm whilst you cook the rest of the chicken. **If you want to ensure the chicken stays extra crispy whilst in the oven, see my 'Top Tips for Success' section in the post.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, make the sauce. Place the gochujang, honey, sugar, soy sauce, garlic, ginger, vegetable oil, and sesame oil in a saucepan and stir together.
            2 tbsp gochujang paste,2 tbsp honey,4 tbsp brown sugar,4 tbsp soy sauce,2 cloves garlic,2 tsp minced ginger,1 tbsp vegetable oil,1 tbsp sesame oil</li>
        <li>Bring to the boil, then simmer for 5 minutes until thickened.</li>
        <li>Pour over the crispy chicken and carefully toss together, then top with the spring onions, chilli flakes, and sesame seeds before serving.
            3 spring onions,1 tsp sesame seeds,½ tsp chilli flakes</li>

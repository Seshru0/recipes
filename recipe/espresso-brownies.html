    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup unsalted butter, cold</li>
      <li>1 cup + 2 tbsp semi-sweet chocolate chips</li>
      <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>3 tbsp dark cocoa powder</li>
      <li>2 tbsp espresso powder</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
      <li>1 1/4 cups granulated sugar</li>
      <li>3 large eggs</li>
      <li>1/2 tbsp vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 350 F/180 C. Line a square 8x8 baking pan with
        parchment paper and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        n a stainless steel pan, brown the butter over medium heat for 10-12
        minutes. While it cooks, the butter will foam, pop, and crackle. This is
        normal! Stand by and stir it occasionally. When the bottom of the pan
        has brown bits of butter solid and it starts to smell nutty, scrape all
        of it into a separate bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the chocolate chips to the bowl of browned butter and stir to melt
        completely. Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a bowl, whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, espresso, and salt.
        Set aside
      </li>
      <li>
        In a mixing bowl, whisk the eggs, sugar, and vanilla together on medium
        speed for 1-2 minutes until fluffy.
      </li>
      <li>
        With the mixer running on low, stream the melted butter and chocolate
        into the batter. Mix until just combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        Gently fold in the dry ingredients with a rubber spatula until just
        combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour the batter into the prepared baking pan. Bake for 30-40 minutes, or
        until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out covered in moist
        crumbs.
      </li>
      <li>
        Let the pan cool completely on a wire rack then cut into 16 squares with
        a hot sharp knife, wiping it clean between cuts.
      </li>
    </ol>
